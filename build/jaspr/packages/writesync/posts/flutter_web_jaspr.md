# Flutter Web vs Jaspr: Choosing the Right Dart Web Framework

When it comes to building web applications with Dart, developers have two powerful options: Flutter Web and Jaspr. Let's explore both frameworks to help you make an informed decision.

## Flutter Web Overview

Flutter Web allows you to build web applications using the same codebase as your mobile apps. Here are some key features:

- Single codebase for mobile, desktop, and web
- Rich widget ecosystem
- Powerful animations and custom painting
- Hot reload for rapid development

```dart
class MyWebApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, Flutter Web!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Jaspr: The New Kid on the Block

Jaspr is specifically designed for web development, offering:

- Smaller bundle sizes
- Better SEO capabilities
- Server-side rendering
- Native web components

```dart
class MyJasprApp extends StatelessComponent {
  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield div(classes: 'container', [
      text('Hello, Jaspr!'),
    ]);
  }
}
```

## Performance Comparison

### Bundle Size
- Flutter Web: ~1MB (gzipped)
- Jaspr: ~100KB (gzipped)

### First Paint
- Flutter Web: 1-2 seconds
- Jaspr: Under 500ms

## When to Choose Each Framework

### Choose Flutter Web When:
- You need cross-platform compatibility
- You want rich animations and complex UI
- You're building a web app that feels like a native app
- You have an existing Flutter codebase

### Choose Jaspr When:
- SEO is crucial for your application
- You need smaller bundle sizes
- You want better integration with web standards
- Server-side rendering is a requirement

## Best Practices

1. Consider your target audience and their devices
2. Evaluate your performance requirements
3. Think about SEO needs
4. Consider your team's expertise
5. Plan for long-term maintenance

## Conclusion

Both frameworks have their strengths. Flutter Web excels in cross-platform development and rich UIs, while Jaspr shines in web-specific scenarios requiring optimal performance and SEO. Choose based on your project's specific needs and constraints.
