# Building Responsive Web Apps with Jaspr

Creating responsive web applications that work seamlessly across all devices is crucial in today's multi-device world. In this post, we'll explore how to build responsive layouts using Jaspr and modern CSS techniques.

## Understanding Responsive Design

Responsive design is about creating web applications that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Key concepts include:

1. **Fluid Grids**: Using relative units instead of fixed pixels
2. **Flexible Images**: Images that scale within their containers
3. **Media Queries**: CSS rules that apply based on device characteristics
4. **Mobile-First Approach**: Designing for mobile devices first

## Using Tailwind CSS with Jaspr

Jaspr works great with Tailwind CSS. Here's how to implement responsive designs:

```dart
div(
  classes: '''
    w-full           // Full width on all screens
    md:w-1/2        // Half width on medium screens
    lg:w-1/3        // One-third width on large screens
    p-4             // Padding on all screens
    md:p-6          // Larger padding on medium screens
    lg:p-8          // Even larger padding on large screens
  ''',
  [
    // Your content here
  ],
)
```

## Responsive Layout Patterns

### Stack to Grid

```dart
div(
  classes: '''
    grid
    grid-cols-1     // Single column on mobile
    md:grid-cols-2  // Two columns on medium screens
    lg:grid-cols-3  // Three columns on large screens
    gap-4
  ''',
  [
    for (final item in items)
      ResponsiveCard(item: item),
  ],
)
```

### Sidebar Layout

```dart
div(
  classes: '''
    flex
    flex-col        // Stack on mobile
    lg:flex-row     // Side by side on large screens
    gap-4
  ''',
  [
    // Sidebar
    div(
      classes: '''
        w-full
        lg:w-64
        lg:flex-shrink-0
      ''',
      [/* Sidebar content */],
    ),
    // Main content
    div(
      classes: 'flex-grow',
      [/* Main content */],
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Responsive Images

Handle images responsively:

```dart
div(
  classes: 'relative aspect-[16/9]',
  [
    img(
      src: imageUrl,
      classes: '''
        absolute
        inset-0
        w-full
        h-full
        object-cover
        rounded-lg
      ''',
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Responsive Typography

Implement responsive text sizes:

```dart
h1(
  classes: '''
    text-2xl        // Base size
    sm:text-3xl     // Larger on small screens
    md:text-4xl     // Even larger on medium screens
    lg:text-5xl     // Largest on large screens
    font-bold
    tracking-tight
  ''',
  [text('Responsive Heading')],
)
```

## Navigation Patterns

### Responsive Navigation Bar

```dart
nav(
  classes: '''
    flex
    flex-col        // Stack on mobile
    sm:flex-row     // Row on larger screens
    items-center
    justify-between
    p-4
  ''',
  [
    // Logo
    img(classes: 'h-8 w-auto'),
    
    // Navigation links
    div(
      classes: '''
        flex
        flex-col        // Stack on mobile
        sm:flex-row     // Row on larger screens
        gap-4
        mt-4           // Spacing on mobile
        sm:mt-0        // Remove spacing on larger screens
      ''',
      [
        // Navigation links
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Mobile-First Development**
   - Start with mobile layouts
   - Add complexity for larger screens
   - Use min-width media queries

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize images for different screen sizes
   - Lazy load off-screen content
   - Minimize layout shifts

3. **Testing**
   - Test on real devices
   - Use browser dev tools
   - Check common breakpoints

4. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure touch targets are large enough
   - Maintain readable text sizes
   - Provide sufficient contrast

## Common Breakpoints

```dart
// Tailwind CSS default breakpoints
final breakpoints = {
  'sm': '640px',   // Small screens
  'md': '768px',   // Medium screens
  'lg': '1024px',  // Large screens
  'xl': '1280px',  // Extra large screens
  '2xl': '1536px', // 2X large screens
};
```

## Handling Dynamic Content

Create flexible layouts that handle varying content:

```dart
div(
  classes: '''
    grid
    grid-cols-1
    sm:grid-cols-2
    lg:grid-cols-3
    auto-rows-fr    // Equal height rows
    gap-4
  ''',
  [
    for (final card in cards)
      div(
        classes: '''
          bg-white
          rounded-lg
          shadow
          p-4
          flex
          flex-col
        ''',
        [
          // Card header
          div(classes: 'flex-shrink-0', [/* Header content */]),
          // Card body
          div(classes: 'flex-grow', [/* Body content */]),
          // Card footer
          div(classes: 'flex-shrink-0', [/* Footer content */]),
        ],
      ),
  ],
)
```
